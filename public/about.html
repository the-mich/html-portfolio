<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Michael Aire, a 17-year-old aspiring Full Stack Web Developer from Nigeria.
  I’m passionate about creating simple, smart, and user-friendly digital solutions that make people’s lives easier.
My journey in tech began out of curiosity, but it quickly grew into a serious passion —and I’ve been learning web development
through a Udemy course, building my skills step by step in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>Beyond coding, I’m a hardworking and creative young person who enjoys solving real-world problems through technology.
  I’m currently balancing my studies, work, and continuous learning to become a professional software engineer.
  My goal is to build impactful web applications and help businesses and individuals bring their ideas to life online.
